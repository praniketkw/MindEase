## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
# 1. Run security audit
npm audit --audit-level high

# 2. Run tests
cd frontend && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
cd backend && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# 3. Build applications
cd frontend && npm run build
cd backend && npm run build

# 4. Validate environment configuration
node -e "console.log('Environment check:', process.env.NODE_ENV)"
```

### 2. Azure Resource Deployment
```bash
# Deploy Azure resources using ARM template
cd deployment
./deploy-with-arm.sh

# Or use the CLI script
./deploy-azure-resources.sh

# Configure Key Vault
./setup-keyvault.sh <key-vault-name>
```

### 3. GitHub Secrets Configuration
Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

**Required Secrets:**
- `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
- `AZURE_LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_LANGUAGE_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_CONTENT_SAFETY_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`
- `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`

**Optional Secrets (for Key Vault integration):**
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME`

### 4. Deploy Application
```bash
# Push to main branch to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Production deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application loads successfully at production URL

- [ ] Voice input/output functionality works
- [ ] Journal entries are encrypted and stored correctly
- [ ] Crisis detection triggers appropriate responses
- [ ] Rate limiting is functioning correctly
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Logs are being generated properly

## Security Monitoring

### 1. Log Monitoring
Monitor the following log files in production:
- `logs/error.log` - Application errors
- `logs/security.log` - Security events
- `logs/combined.log` - All application logs
- `logs/exceptions.log` - Uncaught exceptions
- `logs/rejections.log` - Unhandled promise rejections

### 2. Key Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Response times (< 3 seconds for text, < 5 seconds for voice)
- [ ] Error rates (< 1% for 5xx errors)
- [ ] Authentication failures
- [ ] Rate limiting triggers
- [ ] Crisis detection events
- [ ] Azure service availability

### 3. Security Alerts
Set up alerts for:
- [ ] Multiple authentication failures from same IP
- [ ] Unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] High error rates
- [ ] Azure service outages
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Encryption/decryption failures

## Incident Response

### 1. Security Incident Response Plan
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Identify and isolate the affected systems
